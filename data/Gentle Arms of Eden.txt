Gentle Arms of Eden data

verse
On a sleepy endless ocean, when the world lay in a dream 
There was rhythm in the splash and roll, but not a voice to sing 
So the moon fell on the breakers and the morning warmed the waves 
Till a single cell did jump and hum for joy, as though to say 
D G Cadd9 G / Cadd9 G Cadd9 G Am C / 1 / Cadd9 G Cadd9 G Am D
chorus
This is my home, this is my only home 
This is the only sacred ground that I have ever known 
And should I stray in the dark night a- lone 
Rock me, Goddess, in the gentle arms of Eden 
D G Cadd9 G / G Cadd9 Em D / D G Cadd9 D Em / C G Em C D G
verse
Then the day shone bright and rounder, till the one turned into two 
And the two in- to ten thousand things, and old things into new 
Till on some virgin beachhead, one lonesome critter crawled 
And looked a- bout and shouted out in a most astonished drawl 
verse
Then all the sky was buzzin' and the ground was carpet green 
And the wary children of the wood went dancin' in be- tween 
And the people sang re- joicing, when the fields were glad with grain 
This song of cele- bration from their cities on the plain 
verse
Now there's smoke across the harbor, and there's factories on the shore 
And the world is ill with greed and will and enterprise of war 
But I will lay my burdens in the cradle of your grace 
And the shining beaches of your love and the sea of your em- brace
